#P443 ‘To Cap NGESO Interconnector Trades’
Formal title: To Cap NGESO Interconnector Trades at the Value of Lost Load (VoLL)
At the current time National Grid Electricity System Operator (NGESO) can trade at prices above the Value of Lost Load (VoLL – as defined in BSC Section T 1.12, currently set at £6,000/MWh). The Proposer’s view is that this adds to customers’ costs and sends a signal to the markets that customers are willing to buy power at any price. In a cost of living crisis the Proposer does not believe that the British public are prepared to buy energy at any price.

The solution will require NGESO to cap its offers to Interconnector Users to no more than VoLL, as defined in the BSC. These trades are included in the Balancing Services Adjustment Data (BSAD) file, which is sent from NGESO to Elexon. Elexon process the BSAD file for the purposes of Settlement and reporting.
