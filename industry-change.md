## P443 ‘To Cap NGESO Interconnector Trades’
Formal title: To Cap NGESO Interconnector Trades at the Value of Lost Load (VoLL)

https://www.elexon.co.uk/documents/change/modifications/p401-p450/p443-panel-slides/

At the current time National Grid Electricity System Operator (NGESO) can trade at prices above the Value of Lost Load (VoLL – as defined in BSC Section T 1.12, currently set at £6,000/MWh). The Proposer’s view is that this adds to customers’ costs and sends a signal to the markets that customers are willing to buy power at any price. In a cost of living crisis the Proposer does not believe that the British public are prepared to buy energy at any price.

The solution will require NGESO to cap its offers to Interconnector Users to no more than VoLL, as defined in the BSC. These trades are included in the Balancing Services Adjustment Data (BSAD) file, which is sent from NGESO to Elexon. Elexon process the BSAD file for the purposes of Settlement and reporting.

### Background and Issue
At the current time National Grid Electricity System Operator (NGESO) can trade at prices above the Value of Lost Load (VoLL) – currently 
£6,000/MWh
• This adds to customers’ costs and sends a signal to the markets that customers are willing to buy power at any price
• In a cost of living crisis the Proposer does not believe that the British public are prepared to buy energy at any price and therefore a price 
cap before emergency actions seems a sensible safety net
• If NGESO has a price cap it will signal to the market that it will not simply buy through spiralling prices. Instead, it would cease to buy energy 
and start to use other energy management tools when offers to sell power are above VoLL. The Proposer would see these other actions as 
being:
• Issuing Capacity Market Warnings (CMW), to which interconnectors have an obligation to respond;
• Use Electricity Margin Notices (EMNs); and
• Start to manage demand, either via Demand Side Response (DSR) services or if necessary via load shedding.

### Proposed solution

The Proposer’s preferred option is to alter BSC Section Q ‘Balancing Mechanism Activities’ to add in a new paragraph as follows:
• 6.3.2D For any Balancing Services Adjustment Action [provided using an Interconnector] and with a positive Balancing Services Adjustment 
Volume, the Balancing Services Adjustment Cost cannot be greater than VoLL * Balancing Services Adjustment Volume
• The solution will require NGESO to cap its offers to Interconnector Users to no more than VoLL, as defined in the BSC
• These trades are included in the Balancing Services Adjustment Data (BSAD) file, which is sent from NGESO to Elexon. Elexon process the 
BSAD file for the purposes of Settlement and reporting, with no changes to the file structure or format required
